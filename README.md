### What is reuseable charts in d3?
We often need to reuse a chart in another project, or event share the chart with others. 
For this, Mike Bostock (the creator of D3) proposed a model called [reusable charts](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/).

### Why do this challenge?
You lose your soul of programming if you havn't done that for a long time. When I review my code for vis2019, it's hard for
me to remember what I wrote and why wrote in that way. So, I want to practice my code regularly no matter whether I have code task
for project or not. At the same time, I hope I can write high-quality code which can be useful in future.
